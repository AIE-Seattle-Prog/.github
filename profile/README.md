# AIE Seattle @ GitHub

Welcome to AIE Seattle's GitHub profile!

This organization contains resources for students and faculty alike such as:

- Template Repositories

Some resources are restricted to AIE staff and students. Students or faculty
lacking access to any of these should request it from a faculty member of the
Seattle Campus in the Game Programming dept.

### Subject Resources

Additional resources for each subject can be found.

Subject resources may vary year by year, so we've provided pre-filtered searches
that you can use to browse and find resources for your class.

### Templates

Template repositories can be used to start a new repository with a preconfigured
project, like Raylib. To use one, click on the "Use template button" where the
"Clone" button would ordinarily be.

- [raygame](https://github.com/AIE-Seattle-Prog/raygame), a VS C++ project with Raylib
- [raygamecsharp](https://github.com/AIE-Seattle-Prog/raygamecsharp), a VS C# project with Raylib
